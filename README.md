# Chaser

<b>Chaser is live on Sepolia! [chaser.finance](https://chaser.finance/) </b>

Chaser revolutionizes DeFi investing by empowering users to create data based investment strategies on chain. With granular subgraph data on various DeFi protocols, Chaser pools generate optimal yield while gaining deep control over risk. Factoring in historical and positional subgraph data, Chaser opens up impossible investment strategies like:  

- Deposit WETH into the lending protocol with the lowest 30 day volatility
- Any stablecoin market on Aave that has consistently yielded above 5% in the last year
- Move funds to the best Aave market with no borrows worth +10% of TVL
- Invest into the lending protocol with highest daily volume

After defining the ideal, metric based investment, Chaser will move pool deposits in between different protocols and networks as market conditions change. By calculating these strategies on chain, DAOs and other decentralized protocols can enhance liquidity utilization and maximize returns while setting their own desired risk parameters. 

By routing deposits to lending protocols like Aave and Compound, revenue is made from reliable, time-tested sources. Chaser is built on top of the Across Bridge for cross-chain transactions, Chainlink CCIP for cross-network state management, and the UMA Oracle for automating investment movements. This architecture simplifies the process for DAOs and end users by managing all aspects of cross-chain and cross-protocol routing.

## How does Chaser improve DeFi?

Imagine using the below statstics from Aave/Compound/Spark/etc to determine exactly how your DAO's unused liquidity can be invested:

- Daily market volumes, revenues, opened positions, yields
- Granular data on all open positions
- Protocol wide data, comparisons between cooresponding markets on different networks

Without this kind of data, DeFi investment strategies are very limited. Only current state is available on contracts. There is also a lack of indexed, calculated metrics such as open position balances or user counts. While a single EOA could run a bot off chain, DAOs do not have the luxury of centralizing these determinations. 

Chaser makes it possible to factor all of this in into your DAOs liquidity management. By deploying a pool and defining a strategy script, Chaser moves your funds efficiently while following your desired risk parameters. 

### Example: USDC yields directly in Chaser vs Aave and Compound 

On a Chaser pool with a USDC high yield strategy, we can move funds between Aave and Compound on different networks to the market with the highest USDC yield at that given moment. 

As an example, here are the 90 day APYs for USDC deposits on 8 different Aave and Compound deployments between Feb 1 2024 and May 1 2024. 

- Compound Ethereum: 9.77%
- Compound Arbitrum: 8.00%
- Compound Polygon: 10.28%
- Aave Arbitrum: 9.75%
- Aave Base: 5.90%
- Aave Ethereum: 8.75%
- Aave Optimism: 9.67%
- Aave Polygon: 10.41%

<br>
<br>
<b>CHASER USDC: 14.06%</b>
<br>
<br>

During that same time period, Chaser increases yield significantly by moving funds to the highest market for each day. With 14% APY, it is nearly 4% more than the single market with the best revenues during that same period. No interactions or bridging required by the depositor, as Chaser handles all of that.

## How does Chaser investing work?

Chaser's architecture uses a pool system. Each pool defines a strategy on how and when funds should be moved (see more on this below).
Chaser handles all of the complexities of entering and exiting investment positions on external protocols behind the scenes. 

It is important to keep in mind that when a pool has an investment position on a different network, there are delays when finalizing your interactions. Specifically, deposits to other chains need to bridge and send a callback message before minting pool tokens. Also, withdraws from positions on other chains face similar delays. 

The current idea of the Chaser token is to facilitate instant liquidity for pools with positions on other chains. If there is an open proposal to move the pools funds, there is a block on deposits and withdraws to prevent funds lost when bridging gets executed. This is still strictly a concept and will not be launched any time soon.

## Contracts

### PoolControl

This is the pool that a user/DAO will deploy in order to invest according to their own strategy. Each pool is deployed factory style from the ChaserManager contract. Most state for each pool is stored on the PoolCalculations contract. On the PoolControl, there is a mix of functions for users to call as well as callbacks from inter-chain actions to finalize state changes and fund transfers between chains. The PoolControl is the only contract where users will directly interact with for depositing/withdrawing funds and handling pivots.

#### Pool Tokens

#### Functions

- `function userDepositAndSetPosition(uint256 _amount,uint256 _totalFee,string memory _targetPositionProtocol,bytes memory _targetPositionMarketId,uint256 _targetPositionChain)`
- - The first function you must call after deploying a pool. This function simulataneously sets the initial market position for the pool and makes the first deposit. 
- - `_amount` is the amount denominated in the pool asset to send as first deposit. `_totalFee` is the total amount of the asset that will be paid to the Across bridge in order to move the funds to their destination chain. This fee should be calculated on the frontend/off chain according to Across' reccomendations. If the initial position being set is on Sepolia, this argument does not matter. `_targetPositionProtocol` is the protocol name to set the initial position into (ex. `aave-v3` or `compound-v3`). `_targetPositionMarketId` is the ID of the market entity on the subgraph that corresponds to where your want to deposit into (read below to find this ID). `_targetPositionChain` is the chain ID that this market is on. 

- `function userDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _totalFee)`
- - This function is to make any deposit that is not the initial, position setting deposit. Depending on the current position location, the pool routes this deposit through its other contracts and inter-chain tools to move into position and execute a callback on the pool after finaizing.

- `function userWithdrawOrder(uint256 _amount)`
- - This function makes a request to make a withdraw for the caller. Depending on the position location, this is a request to be validated and fulfilled depending on the position value on the other chain. The pool contract does not have access to the current position value when deposited to other chains. This request checks the users proportion of pool tokens and then compares the asset amount requested to this proportion of the total pool. Once verified, the funds are bridged back to the pool and forwarded to the user.  

- `function queryMovePosition(string memory _requestProtocol,bytes memory _requestMarketId,uint256 _requestChainId)`
- - `queryMovePosition` is called to open a proposal to pivot funds. It calls the Arbitration contract to create an UMA assertion. If the assertion is approved, the oracle calls `sendPositionChange` on the PoolControl in order to put the pivot into motion

- `function readPoolCurrentPositionData() view returns (address,bytes32,uint256,uint256,uint256,string memory,bytes memory);`
- - Returns the current state of the pool and it's position.
- - Return values in order: currentPositionAddress,currentPositionProtocolHash,currentRecordPositionValue,currentPositionValueTimestamp, currentPositionChain,currentPositionProtocol,currentPositionMarketId
- - currentRecordPositionValue and currentPositionValueTimestamp are recorded at the time of the last cross chain interaction. For up to date value of the position, it needs to be read on the BridgeLogic contract of the chain where funds current are

### BridgeLogic

This contract is deployed on each chain that Chaser supports. It serves as a connection between the cross-chain services and positions. Funds and data originating from the PoolControl are passed between chains to the BridgeConnect, which then processes the requested actions on the chain where funds are held. Positional state is live updated and stored here. This contract is upgradeable.

#### Functions

These functions are only valid when called on the chain that is holding a given pool's investment. They will return 0 on all chains that are not holding the pool's position. 

- `function getUserMaxWithdraw(uint256 _currentPositionValue,uint256 _scaledRatio) view returns (uint256)`
- - This function returns an up to date maximum withdraw for a depositor, accounting for interest gains on the deposit. It is used whenever a user attempts to make a withdraw to determine the total amount of assets that pertain to them. This function is also useful off-chain for getting user balances.
- - `_currentPositionValue` is the non-pending position balance for the pool, ie the current position value including interest while accounting for deposits/withdraws that have not finalized yet. Because of Chaser's cross chain architecture, pending deposits/withdraws affect the position amounts before pool tokens are minted/burned
- - `_scaledRatio` is the percentage of pool tokens owned by the user out of the entire pool token supply, scaled up by 10**18. This ratio helps calculate how much of the total position value belongs to the user.    

- `function getPositionBalance(address _poolAddress) view returns (uint256)`
- - For the current balance pertaining to a pool without factoring for pending interactions. Reads the balance directly from external protocol that the pool invested into. 

- `function getNonPendingPositionBalance(address _poolAddress,uint256 _poolDepoNonce,uint256 _poolWithNonce) view returns (uint256)`
- - The true balance that takes out all of the pending transactions that have not finalized. Used for calculating pool token amounts to mint or burn.


### Integrator

The Integrator contract is resposible for compatibility with external protocols. It contains logic specific to each supported protocol to enable deposits, withdraws and balance reads on each protocol. It is only callable by BridgeLogic to facilitate investments into their different markets. The way this contract manages investments for all pools is by deploying a PoolBroker contract for each pool. This contract holds pool/position tokens for the external protocol that a Chaser pool is invested in. This way investments do not get mixed and token balances are better segmented by pool. A pool has one of these contracts on each chain that it has pivoted to at some point.

### BridgeReceiver

This contract handles Across bridging to route funds and data depending on the operation. It is callable by the Across SpokePool. It includes error handling to refund users and undo state changes in the event of an execution error.

### BridgeMessenger

For CCIP messaging, the contract handles message reception between chains and generates messages to be sent. There is no error handling for these messages because their are no funds being transfered. Failed message handling would only require a contract upgrade to be deployed before reexcuting. This contract requires a LINK balance to send out messages. Soon, this contract will automatically swap deposits for LINK and maintain a balance without top-ups. While on Testnet, this balance is subsidized and maintained by Chaser.

### Arbitration Contract

For executing opening proposals and initiating pivot execution, the Arbitration contract connects to the UMA protocol. It reads current pool state and generates an UMA claim. Disputers active on UMA will see this claim, and execute the pool's strategy script to determine whether or not the pivot proposal actually points to a better investment for your strategy than the current position.

### Pivoting Pool Funds

The process of proposing a new position and moving position upon success is called "pivoting". After someone successfully proposes a new position to the UMA oracle, we must "pivot" the pool's deposits by exiting the current position and moving into the new position.

#### Proposing a new Position

Starting on a pool page, we fill out the inputs in the "Pivot Position" section. While in development, the market ID selection is auto selected. In production there will be a list of markets to choose from.

<b>1) Click on "Send Pivot" to begin the proposal process</b>
<br>
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelC1999/chaser/master/media/pivot1.png" target="_blank" ><img src="./media/pivot1.png" width="600px"/></a>
<br>

<br>
<b>2) Click "Open Proposal" to go through the entirety of the pivot process including the oracle assertion and resolution. During development, the assertion liveness is set to 5 minutes for the sake of expediency. In production, this will be configurable on the pool with a set of options. There is also the "Skip Proposal, Execute Pivot" button which bypasses the Oracle assertion in the case you want to test only the process of exiting/entering positions.</b>

<br>

<br>
<b>3) After opening the proposal, the popup will show the current state of the assertion. It shows the position that has been proposed and is currently being verified in the UMA protocol. This popup also shows whether or not deposits/withdraws are paused on the pool, as Chaser blocks interactions on pools after passing 60% of liveness time in a proposal. This is to prevent funds getting lost between chains if being processed while the pivot is executing. When available, an "Execute Pivot" button appears to begin the position change. </b>

<b>5) After sending in the transaction, the popup will show the status of the pivot as it moves between chains. Depending on the location of funds and its destination, this will show a combination of Across bridge deposits and CCIP messages.</b>

### Strategies

Chaser strategies are based on custom written Javascript logic that query subgraph data and analyze metrics on a market. Each proposal to move deposits on a Chaser pool requires a user submit a protocol name, network and market ID that points to a market entity on the Messari subgraph for that protocol. The proposal generates a node command that UMA Oracle disputers execute in order to verify that this proposal would be a better investment for the defined strategy. This is determined by executing the Javascript logic and receiving `true` as the return value. When a pool is deployed, the strategy is set and unchangeable.

It is best to write a strategy using the template in `strategyTemplate.js`. Here are some of the rules for creating Chaser strategies:

- The maximum file size is 24kb
- Declare each supported asset address supported on each chain in the `supportedChainsAssets` object.
- Perform your numerical analysis/comparison on any metric listed in the subgraph query. Any metric you do not end up using for your strategy's analysis, feel free to remove from the query
- In the custom logic section, write any sorts of validations and checks you want to perform to prevent a pool from pivoting deposits
- In the case of an error querying or executing logic, return false and do not let the pool pivot
- After processing the subgraph data, make some sort of condition to return true and declare that the pool should pivot deposits to the proposed market
- The query pulls data snapshots of the given market every day for the last year and a market entity that gets the current state of these metrics.
- Enabled protocols and networks are configured on the pool contracts. There is no need to validate against these values within the strategy 

Soon, these strategies will be based off of executing logic held in a Github repo. This will allow for a larger logic file size, external libraries and deeper analysis in general. Also, there will be support for positional data for analyzing markets with granular deposit and borrow data points.

### Verifying Pivot Proposals

## Technical

Here are the essential tools that make Chaser work
- Across Bridge, for facilitating investments between different networks.
- Chainlink CCIP, for interacting and managing state between different networks
- UMA Oracle, for the system of proposing/moving deposits between markets
- The Graph, for access to decentralized, trusted data on DeFi protocols. Specifically Messari Standardized Subgraphs for providing decentralized, indexable DeFi data

### Investment Process

For an end user or DAO depositing into a pool, the only interaction needed is to make a deposit on the origin chain Pool contract. Chaser handles the cross-chain and cross-protocol routing behind the scenes. 

#### Mechanics of custom investment strategies

Strategy contracts help UMA OO disputers make an objective, data-based determination as to whether or not a proposed investment is better for the given strategy. Before moving investments, a pool must go through a process of determining whether or not to move  

- A user proposes that a given market is a better investment than the market where funds are currently deposited into, according to the current strategy (example: The Compound-Mainnet ETH market returns a higher yield with lower 30 day volatility than the current market on AAVE-V3-Optimism WETH) 
- This proposal opens up an UMA assertion with a combination of the target protocol + network + market address and a hardcoded proposal template complete with instructions on how disputers can verify the proposal.
- UMA disputers verify that this proposal is true by reading the Javascript code saved on the strategy contract and executing it locally with a provided command.
- This code queries the subgraphs of the lending markets in question and analyzes their data.
- This code returns `true` if the proposed investment is currently better for your strategy than the current market the pool is invested into, and should therefore move funds to the new market.
- If the code returns `false`, the proposed market is not a better investment and is not worth moving funds. Disputers will  
- When a proposal is successful, Chaser unwinds the current position and sends the funds through the Across bridge to whatever network the new, better investment is on. This function also sends a CCIP message to the destination network with instructions on how and where to deposit the funds

See the strategy contract creation tutorial above to make your own strategy.


#### Mechanics of a deposit

- A DAO/user makes a deposit into a Chaser Pool
- The PoolControl calls the 'depositV3' function on the local Across V3 SpokePool to send funds and data to the chain where this pool currently has an investment position
- The BridgeReceiver contract handles the bridged funds and data. This gets forwarded to the BridgeLogic contract which then uses the Integrator contract to connect with the external protocol such as Aave or Compound
- The Integrator contract standardizes connections to external protocols like Aave and Compound. This routes deposits to the appropriate market, performs reads to get the current value of the position, and facilitates withdraws from the protocol
- After the Integrator and BridgeReceiver finish processing the deposit, a CCIP message is sent through the ChaserMessenger contract back to the origin chain
- The ChaserMessenger *on the origin chain* receives this CCIP message and calls functions on the PoolControl contract in order to finalize the deposit
- The PoolControl updates the pool state and mints the user tokens to denominate their position

#### Mechanics of a withdraw

As deposits are usually being invested in other protocols on other chains, liquidity is not instant. Liquidity varies based on Across bridging time and CCIP message finality. On testnet, this can take up to 30 minutes for a withdraw to finalize. On mainnet, this should be much quicker but still not instant.

- DAO/user interacts with the PoolControl contract to request a withdraw
- If the deposits are on a different chain, the ChaserMessenger sends a CCIP message to request the withdraw
- This withdraw request includes the user's proportion of out of all the Pool's position tokens. As the origin chain does not have access to the investment's current value including interest, this is necessary to determine how much a user is actually entitled to.
- The ChaserMessenger *on the destination chain* processes this message and routes the function through the BridgeLogic contract
- BridgeLogic makes the withdraw using the Integrator contract to interact with the protocol that the funds are currently invested into
- The withdrawn funds are sent by BridgeLogic back to the origin chain by using the Across bridge
- The BridgeReceiver forwards the funds and data to the Pool which then updates state and sends the funds to the user

#### Mechanics of pivoting investment

Chaser pivots based off of comparison. We optimistically assume that the current market where deposits are currently invested in is the best investment at the moment for the pool's strategy. When someone proposes that a different market is better than the current market according to the strategy logic, they put up a bond in order to assert this on the UMA oracle. Pools can be configured to reward these assertions in order to incentivize monitoring the investment for he best possible strategy.

Any entity can propose to the UMA Oracle a new market for your pool to invest in based on your strategy. Strategies have a measureable, numeric determination of which market is a better investment.

As strategies determine when to move funds based off of querying subgraphs, proposing pivots are easily automateable. Soon there will be an official Chaser pivot bot for download

If a pivot proposal is deemed successful by the UMA OO, Chaser will then withdraw the funds from the current position and move deposits into the new, proposed market. If the current position and or the proposed position sit on a different chain than the pool, Chaser will use CCIP and Across to send funds and manage state while changing positions.

#### Mechanics of deploying a pool

- A user selects and asset and a strategy
- PoolControl contract gets deployed with the user's parameters
- The user who deployed the new pool sends both a deposit and data to set the initial position by providing a protocol-market-chain combination on some other DeFi protocol that pays a yield on deposits
- The Chaser contracts on the destination chain handle the state updates and connections necessary to initialize the investment
- On a pool's first pivot to a chain, the registry deploys a PoolBroker contract to hold the position for this pool separated from the funds of other pools.  

### External Protocol Integration

- In order to enable Chaser access to other protocols such as Compound or Aave, the Integration contract needs to be upgraded with interfaces and logic to execute the following operations on the protocol's smart contracts
    - Depositing on behalf of a provided address
    - Withdraws
    - Reading the position value of a given liquidity provider, denominated in the asset deposited. This value should be current and including yield.
- There is no updating needed from the other protocols, Chaser is completely backwards compatible
- For now, these protocol integratons will be developed and maintained by the Chaser team for security purposes. However this will eventually be community developed with incentives to expand reach while maintaining quality
- The integration contract receives input from other Chaser contracts as to what protocol/market/asset is being invested into. With this input, the integration contract routes deposits and withdraw requests using specialized logic to account for particularities of each protocol.  
- Deposits are credited to the PoolBroker contract for the sake of keeping revenues, balances, and data separated and individual for each pool
- All withdraw requests have the PoolBroker receive the deposits, then pass them through the Integration contract to wherever the funds reach their destination (pool, other protocol, bridging, etc)
- NOTE: During development, the Integration contract logic has sections where assetAddresses are changed to hardcoded values. This is because the testnet versions of some assets are different by protocol. The WETH used by Across is different than the WETH used by Aave, for example.
